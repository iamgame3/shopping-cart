# Shopping Cart

This app is meant to test me on my ability to use ReactJS client-side routing and component testing.

To run this app, you'll need to download the build repository and run it on a local server. As for the app itself, click Home or Store to switch between the homepage and the store. Add the amount of whatever item you want (min of 0 max of 10) by either typing it or incrementing it and add it to the cart. The cart has no funtionality, since I have no doomsday devices on hand to sell.

P.S. This app is a part of The Odin Project's course.
